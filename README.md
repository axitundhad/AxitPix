### AXITPIX
  
</div>

*I developed AxitPix not only as a learning project, but also as a real-world example of how even individuals and small business owners can bring their products online through a sleek, modern digital platform. This site features full integration with Razorpay for secure, real-time bank-to-bank transactions, and includes various functionalities such as high-quality image management, variant-based licensing, and responsive design. My goal was to demonstrate that selling online doesn't require a massive team or complex infrastructure‚Äîit just needs the right vision and execution. If you're a seller or entrepreneur who wants to build something similar, I'd be happy to help turn your ideas into a working, fully customized platform.*
